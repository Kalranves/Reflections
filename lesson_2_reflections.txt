What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository hidden folder .git with metadata is 
created. You need to do this to keep track of changes made to repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is placed between working directory and the repository.
It isn't directory you work on, also it's not the repository which
have already commited files. Thanks to staging area you can choose 
which files will be tracked and commited and which does not.
