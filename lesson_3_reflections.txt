When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

Using a remote repository is helpful when working on project with other
people or using multiple computers.
Also its good to have backup online if something happens to your PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Its because if Git pulls automatically something might stop working 
correctly while you are in the middle of doing something else.
