When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

Using a remote repository is helpful when working on project with other
people or using multiple computers.
Also its good to have backup online if something happens to your PC.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Its because if Git pulls automatically something might stop working 
correctly while you are in the middle of doing something else.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

You make forks on GitHub from someones else repository that you can 
have it on your GitHub and make changes to it. By clonning you get the 
repository to your local machine. Branches exist inside one repository.
